This project aims to provide a descriptive analysis of Brazil's photovoltaic potential. 

## Objectives
The main objective is to understand Brazil's photovoltaic market, highlighting patterns that change through sazonality and location.

- Understand the market dynamics, and how it changes through time;
- Identify the regions and states with the higher number of installed photovoltaic systems;
- Identify the states with the most advantages for solar energy production;


## Data sources
I've used the following public data sources:
- [Brazilian Atlas of Solar Energy](http://labren.ccst.inpe.br/atlas_2017.html): Developed by INPE in collaboration with several Brazilian institutions, presents a significant review of irradiance measurements in Brazil. It uses more than 17 years of satellite data and improvements in the BRASIL-SR model;

- [EPE](https://www.epe.gov.br/pt/publicacoes-dados-abertos/publicacoes/consumo-de-energia-eletrica): Contains historical series, from 2004 onwards, of monthly and annual consumption of electricity at national, regional and subsystem levels, segmented by the residential, industrial, commercial and other classes (rural, public service and public lighting);

- [ANEEL](https://dadosabertos.aneel.gov.br/dataset/relacao-de-empreendimentos-de-geracao-distribuida): Presents details about photovoltaic systems installed in the country and other sources of electricity.




## Results

Given all insights gained from the analysis, some stood out from the rest:

- Despite the northeastern states boasting the country's highest irradiance index, their remarkable energy consumption places them second only to the southeastern region;
- Surprisingly, the southern states, despite receiving less solar radiation, hold the second-largest number of installed photovoltaic systems;
- The southeastern states lead the nation both in energy consumption and photovoltaic energy production, a reflection of their economic prowess;
- While Brazil witnessed a surge in installed photovoltaic systems, particularly mini-generation, between 2018 and 2019, a post-pandemic stagnation has persisted, culminating in a stark reality: the country currently produces photovoltaic energy at a rate 3418 times less than its voracious energy demand.

## Usage

There's two ways to have a more in depth reading of this analysis:

- [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marcosgabriel/project-brazil-photovoltaic-potential): The full article, where you'll have acess to the code used to create it and all the foughts that made me reach my conclusions. It's written to be a step by step guide on how to reproduce the analysis;

- [Linkedin article](): A more concise version of the analysis, where I'll try to explain the main points, without any code.
